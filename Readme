Migrating EKS cluster from ASG to Karpenter. 
the rest of the project is legusy from th previous project:
Project: Three-Tier Application Deployment
Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a three-tier application consisting of a frontend, backend, and MongoDB service. The application is built with Docker and deployed to Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). The frontend and backend services communicate via Kubernetes Ingress and external DNS routing.

Components
Frontend: A Vue.js application hosted on NGINX, served as a static site.
Backend: A RESTful API built with Nest.js, running on port 3001.
MongoDB: A MongoDB service running in the Kubernetes cluster.
Infrastructure and Pipeline
Terraform: Used for infrastructure as code (IaC) to manage and provision the resources on AWS, including EKS clusters and associated services.
Azure DevOps: Handles the continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipeline to build, test, and deploy Docker images for the frontend, backend, and MongoDB services to EKS.
Key Technologies
Docker: For building containerized applications.
Kubernetes (EKS): For container orchestration and deployment.
NGINX Ingress: For routing traffic to the appropriate services within the Kubernetes cluster.
Cloudflare DNS: Used to route domain traffic (wbapp.test.dv) to the appropriate EKS service.
Terraform: For IaC to provision AWS resources.
Azure DevOps: For pipeline automation to build and push images to ECR and deploy to EKS.
Deployment
Set Up Terraform Infrastructure:
Use Terraform to provision the EKS cluster, associated VPC, and security groups.
Configure IAM roles and policies for EKS access.
Build Docker Images:
Use Azure DevOps pipelines to build and push Docker images for frontend, backend, and MongoDB services to Amazon ECR.
Deploy to EKS:
Use Kubernetes manifests for deployment, ensuring each service is running in the appropriate namespace (backend-check).
Configure Ingress:
Set up an NGINX Ingress resource to route HTTP traffic from wbapp.test.dv to the backend and frontend services.
DNS Routing:
Configure Cloudflare DNS to point to the AWS Load Balancer (ELB) of the EKS cluster for external access.
Environment Variables
VUE_APP_API_URL: Dynamically set via Kubernetes Deployment, used by the frontend to interact with the backend API.Migration
